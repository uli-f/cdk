    Introduction
</h1>
This package provides functionality related to RInChI.
<ol>
    <li>RInChIGenerator: Given an IReaction generate RInChI, RAuxInfo, Long-RInChIKey, Short-RInChIKey and
        Web-RInChIKey.
    </li>
    <li>RInChIToReaction: Given a RInChI and optionally an associated RAuxInfo generate a IReaction.</li>
    <li>RInChIDecomposition: Given a RInChI and optionally an associated RAuxInfo decompose the RInChI into its
        constituent InChIs and AuxInfos.
    </li>
</ol>
<h1>
    Known Limitations
</h1>
<p>
    The functionality of the native RInChI library, the capabilities of CDK, and the required interconversions
    of their inputs and outputs results in known limitations.
</p>
<h2>
    Stereochemical Information
</h2>
<p>
    The native RInChI library infers stereochemical information from 2D/3D coordinates of the input files. Consequently,
    there are scenarios where the stereochemical information gets lost when generating RInChI from a given CDK
    <code>IReaction</code> and generating a CDK <code>IReaction</code> from a RInChI. As the 2D/3D coordinates
    are not stored in the RInChI itself, but instead in an associated RAuxInfo string retaining the RAuxInfo string
    is key if the stereochemical layers of the RInChI are of importance.
</p>
<p>
    Consequently, if a RInChI does not come with an associated RAuxInfo that includes 2D/3D coordinates for its reaction
    components any stereochemical information that is present in the RInChI string gets lost when converting from a RInChI
    to a CDK <code>IReaction</code>.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the conversion from a CDK <code>IReaction</code> to a RInChI string is also impacted by this:
    For double bond and allene atom stereo elements to be considered by the native RInChI library the CDK
    <code>IReaction</code> must have 2D or 3D coordinates for the atoms of its constituent components.
</p>
<h2>
    Agents
</h2>
<p>
    The official RXN syntax as specified in <i>CTFile Formats Biova Databases 2020</i> by Dassault Syst√®mes only
    includes reagents and products on the <i>count line</i>
    of the RXN. Moreover, agents are also omitted from the list of Molfiles (but may be found within the data block of
    the RXN). There is an unofficial extension with
    regard to agents that was originally suggested by ChemAxon where the counts of agents is added to the counts line of
    the RXN and the structural information of
    agents is added as Molfiles.
</p>
<p>
    If there are any agents present in the <code>IReaction</code> object and CDK is used to write a RXN V2000 file using
    its <code>MDLRXNWriter</code>, the number of
    agents is added to the count line of the RXN. This, unfortunately, causes an error if the RXN is then used as an
    input for the native RInChI library. However,
    the native RInChI library is able to consider agents if they are specified within an RDfile, that is, in the counts
    line of an RXN record of an RDfile. This is
    the reason that RDfile is the preferred (and default) input format to feed into the native RInChI library when
    producing a RInChI and consuming a
    <code>IReaction</code> by making calls to RInChIGenerator.
</p>
<p>
    The flag <code>useCDK_MDL_IO</code> is used to specify the input format for RInChIGenerator. Please note that the
    calls to RInChIGenerator are placed from
    RInChIGeneratorFactory::getRInChIGenerator(IReaction,RinchiOptions,boolean).
    <br>
    <code>useCDK_MDL_IO</code> set to <code>false</code> (default): CDK's <code>IReaction</code> object is converted to
    a <code>RinchiInput</code> object.
    The <code>RinchiInput</code> instance is consumed by and converted to an RDfile by the <code>jna-rinchi</code>
    library. The RDfile is then used as an
    input for the native RInChI library. Any information regarding agents is successfully retained in all objects along
    this chain and processed
    by the native RInChI library.
    <br>
    <code>useCDK_MDL_IO</code> set to <code>true</code>: This uses CDK's capabilities to convert the
    <code>IReaction</code> object to an RXN V2000. Prior
    to this conversion any agents present in the reaction are removed to ensure that the resultant RXN V2000 can be
    consumed by the native RInChI library.
    Next, this agent-less RXN V2000 is consumed by the <code>jna-rinchi</code> library and passed on to the native
    RInChI library as an input.
