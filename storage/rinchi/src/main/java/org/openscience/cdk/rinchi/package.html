<h1>
    Introduction
</h1>
This package provides functionality related to RInChI.
<ol>
    <li>RInChIGenerator: Given an IReaction generate RInChI, RAuxInfo, Long-RInChIKey, Short-RInChIKey and Web-RInChIKey.</li>
    <li>RInChIToReaction: Given a RInChI and optionally an associated RAuxInfo generate a IReaction.</li>
    <li>RInChIDecomposition: Given a RInChI and optionally an associated RAuxInfo decompose the RInChI into its constituent InChIs and AuxInfos.</li>
</ol>
<h1>
    Known Limitations
</h1>
<p>
    The functionality of the native RInChI library, the capabilities of CDK, and the required interconversions
    of their inputs and outputs results in known limitations.
</p>
<h2>
    Stereochemical Information
</h2>
The native RInChI library infers stereochemical information from 2D/3D coordinates of the input files.
Consequently, if a RInChI does not come with an associated RAuxInfo that includes 2D/3D coordinates any stereochemical
information that is present in the RInChI string gets lost when converting
<ol>
    <li>from RInChI to a CDK Reaction - which ends up not having any 2D/3D coordinates for the atoms - and then</li>
    <li>from this CDK Reaction back to RInChI.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    In general, if a CDK IReaction does not have coordinates for its reaction components a RInChI generated from it ...
    @Nikolay TODO can you please finish this sentence and/or amend other information that is relevant when it comes to the potential loss of stereochemical information?
