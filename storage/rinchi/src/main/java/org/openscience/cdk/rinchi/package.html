<h1>
    Introduction
</h1>
This package provides functionality related to RInChI.
<ol>
    <li>RInChIGenerator: Given an IReaction generate RInChI, RAuxInfo, Long-RInChIKey, Short-RInChIKey and Web-RInChIKey.</li>
    <li>RInChIToReaction: Given a RInChI and optionally an associated RAuxInfo generate a IReaction.</li>
    <li>RInChIDecomposition: Given a RInChI and optionally an associated RAuxInfo decompose the RInChI into its constituent InChIs and AuxInfos.</li>
</ol>
<h1>
    Known Limitations
</h1>
<p>
    The functionality of the native RInChI library, the capabilities of CDK, and the required interconversions
    of their inputs and outputs results in known limitations.
</p>
<h2>
    Stereochemical Information
</h2>
The native RInChI library infers stereochemical information from 2D/3D coordinates of the input files.
Consequently, if a RInChI does not come with an associated RAuxInfo that includes 2D/3D coordinates any stereochemical
information that is present in the RInChI string gets lost when converting
<ol>
    <li>from RInChI to a CDK Reaction - which ends up not having any 2D/3D coordinates for the atoms - and then</li>
    <li>from this CDK Reaction back to RInChI.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    In general, if a CDK IReaction does not have coordinates for its reaction components, the RInChI generated from it will
    have reaction components without stereo. Also, if 2D/3D coordinates are missing, the stereo information is lost even when components' stereo (e.g. chiral atoms)
    is specified topologically on a 0D level using CDK list of StereoElement objects. 
</p>
<h2>
    Agents
</h2>
<p>
    If the conversion of a CDK IReaction object to RInChI is performed with option <b>useCDK_MDL_IO = true</b>, then 
    the agents (if present) are lost during the conversion. This is so, because the native RInChI library cannot read agents 
    from the RXN V2000 format, produced by CDK.
    Alternatively, the default conversion procedure (<b>useCDK_MDL_IO = false</b>) does not have such a limitation, since internally 
    MDL RDFile format is used instead of RXN format.  
</p>
<p>
    The agent types information is not supported by the native RInChI library 
    hence distinguishing different agent types cannot be done (e.g. catalysts, solvents etc.).
